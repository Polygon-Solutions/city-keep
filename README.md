CityKeep is a web application designed to facilitate the reporting of non-emergency civic issues within your community. Whether it's a pothole, a missing sign, or any other public infrastructure concern, this app provides an easy and efficient way to bring attention to such issues.

Built using ReactJS, MaterialUI, Express, and PostgreSQL, CityKeep offers a user-friendly interface and seamless functionality. The app incorporates features for authentication, account management, report submission, and report display.

## Key Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can create an account, log in, and manage their profile information. This ensures that reports are associated with the correct user and allows for a personalized experience.

- **Report Submission**: Users can submit detailed reports on civic issues they encounter. The app prompts users to provide relevant information such as the location, description, and category of the issue. This data helps authorities and community members take appropriate action.

- **Report Display**: The app provides various ways to view the submitted reports. Users can access the most recent reports to stay informed about the latest issues in their area. Additionally, reports can be filtered based on the current user, enabling individuals to easily track the status of their own submissions.

## Purpose

CityKeep is a personal project created for job search purposes. It serves as a demonstration of proficiency in building full-stack web applications using ReactJS, MaterialUI, Express, and PostgreSQL. The project showcases important aspects such as user authentication, database integration, API development, and responsive frontend design.

By developing CityKeep, I aimed to create a practical solution to streamline the reporting process for non-emergency civic issues. This app demonstrates my ability to architect and implement a user-friendly interface, handle user authentication, and utilize a database to store and retrieve data effectively.

## Acknowledgements

I would like to express my heartfelt appreciation to Braiden Cutforth for his invaluable mentorship and support in the creation of this app. His guidance and expertise were instrumental in bringing this project to fruition.
